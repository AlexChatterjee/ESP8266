# ESP8266
Some ongoing work done on the NodeMCU v2: from blinking (duh) to connecting to a website and reading gpio ports - code in Arduino C++ and Server PHP.

Base version feature:
-> connecting to a server using https unsecure mode and send a payload
-> PHP server script included
-> reading the temperature from the DHT11 sensor

All the code is seperated in librairies
